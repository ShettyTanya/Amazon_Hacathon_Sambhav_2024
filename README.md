# Amazon_Hacathon_Sambhav_2024
This project introduces an innovative GenAI-powered tool that seamlessly converts social media content into optimized Amazon product listings, bridging the gap between influencer-driven sales and structured e-commerce platforms. Social media has become a powerful channel for brands and influencers to promote products, generating high demand but often lacking a streamlined buying experience, with issues like missing delivery tracking, complex order management, and unstructured communication disrupting the customer journey. This tool resolves these challenges by leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to analyze unstructured social media content—capturing product details from captions, hashtags, images, and videos—to create Amazon-ready listings. The GenAI model extracts relevant data such as product names, descriptions, features, and benefits, transforming it into SEO-friendly titles, detailed descriptions, and organized images that meet Amazon’s standards. This automation enables brands and influencers to convert social media engagement into structured e-commerce listings, enhancing reach, customer satisfaction, and reliability.
